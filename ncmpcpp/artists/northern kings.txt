Northern Kings is a Melodic Metal group of famous Finnish musicians, consisting of

Tony Kakko (Sonata Arctica)
Marco Hietala (Nightwish, Tarot)
J-P Lepp&auml;luoto (Charon)
Jarkko Ahola (Ter&auml;sbetoni)

Background singing by  Aleksi Parviainen  (Soulcage)

The group is not an ordinary band, but a league of four vocalists, who are all frontmen of successful heavy metal bands. They wanted to create something special together and came up with an idea of arranging 80's classics to metal versions - sung by all the four together. 

The tracks from their current album, "Reborn", include legendary pieces such as "I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight" by Cutting Crew, "Take On Me" by a-ha, "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey, "Wanted Dead Or Alive" by Bon Jovi, "My Way" by Frank Sinatra, "In The Air Tonight" by Phil Collins, "Brothers In Arms" by Dire Straits and "Sledgehammer" by Peter Gabriel.

Song arrangements by Aleksi Parviainen except "I Just Died In Yours Arms Tonight" and &quot;Don't Bring Me Down" by J.Ahola and "Brothers In Arms" by Mikko P. Mustonen.
